JUNKY
a text-based javascript adventure

---

Vaguely inspired by the classic W.S. Burroughs novel, Junky is a retro, text-based adventure game written in Node.

As a first attempt at game programming and written in an effort to learn more about Node, it's going to be super rough and weirdly designed, eschewing sensible libraries in favor of all kinds of dumb reinventing the wheel, because that's how you learn.
